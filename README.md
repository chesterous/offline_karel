# One File Karel IDE

Provides an IDE for editing and running Karel code, but is completely contained in a single HTML file.

## Description

Students in Stanford Code in Place, prior to learning Python, learn a Python-like variant of Karel programming using online resources. This project tries to replicate most of the functionality of those resources, but does not require an internet connection and can be run locally.
